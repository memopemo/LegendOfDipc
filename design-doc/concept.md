## Synopsis

- After butting in and getting in the gas station line first, the person behind the Player who runs a secret magic cult zaps them with a tiny bit of magic.

- After the Player gets home, they suddenly start to turn into a raccoon, rush out of the door and into the woods where they fall unconsious on a rock.

- The player wakes up, finds that they are turned into a raccoon, and needs to turn themselves back somehow.

- Throughout the course of the game, the player discovers a secret magic cult that is turning pesky people into animals and expensive inanimate objects to be sold for more wealth.

- The Player uncovers a deliberatley vague tale of the Legend of Dipc throughout that can be interpreted by many people in different ways.

- The player discovers various weird events, some are trippy, some are freightening, and some are funny.

- The player discovers secret areas that further the lore. Some are incredibly hard to get to and will require either datamining, luck, or knowledge about other games.

- The player discovers underground dungeons that have loot.

- The player discovers various animal villages relating to the area that allow you to rest, get hints on nearby secrets, and buy things from a shop.

- The player enters houses depending on schedules of people and gets upgradable loot.

- The player discovers seemingly empty houses that contain a dungeon in the basement, where they fight one of 7 cult leaders, get one or more key items, and is taught how to use them throughout the dungeon.

- The player bounces between 4 main areas: neighborhood, town, magic forest, forest

- The player uses key items in creative ways in order to access secret areas that contain loads of money, food, or collectables.

- The player has their own house they can customize with collectables.

- The player gets all 7 keys to the 8th house, and enters gigantic and difficult dungeon that uses many items, contains difficult enemies that gradually goes deeper and deeper to the final boss, the cult leader, near the entrance to the underground where large demons are wanting to get out.

- The player defeats the final boss, the cult leader, and the game is finished.

- (normal ending) A cutscene that plays that shows the cult leader being banished to hell, along with their cult followers. You walk back to your home unchanged and rest.

- (good ending) A cutscene that plays that shows the cult leader turning people back into their normal selves across the town, the police arrest him, and the player doesnt turn back into a raccoon, which he is glad to see, and walks off to another town. It will also give you a new title screen, and the ability to play the game again (new game +) with more tougher enemies, boss fights and more.

- Beating new game + will give you another title screen, the good ending, and a very large and special collectable.

- 100%-ing the game, including finding every secret, results in a very special title screen.

- The player has the ability to hold a specified button to slow the game world to give the player a minute to think about what to do, preventing players from feeling overwhelmed at difficulty (maybe toggleable in difficulty settings?)
