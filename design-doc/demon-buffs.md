# Demon Buffs

Allows the player to temporarily gain certain small helpful abilities and buffs by collecting [Demon Pendants](obtainables.md#demon-pendants).

Collecting new Pendants will give the player as many new buffs as they have collected pendants in total times 2 minus 1. These are distributed between which pendants you have already collected.

- For example, if you have collected pendants 1, 2, and 5, and you just grabbed pendant 6, then you have previously had 9 buffs to choose from: 3 each from pendants 1, 2, and 5. You now have 16. 4 each from pendants 1, 2, 5 and 6.

|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|-|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|-|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|-|-|

Once Pendant 6 is collected...

|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|!|!|-|-|!|!|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|!|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|!|-|
|X|X|-|-|X|!|-|

So your total buffs to choose from at any time is (pendants_collected)^2

## Buff Demon

A demon in your [House](/overworld.md#players-house) that can be summoned in order to select buffs.

You summon him after collecting 5 [TP](/obtainables.md#toilet-paper).

- A mystical aura appears around the pentagram of 5 rolls, if you interact with it, a portal opens up in the floor and a demon reaches out his hands and climbs up.
- Interacting with him opens the menu for selecting demon buffs by paying with [TP](/obtainables.md#toilet-paper)

### Selecting Buffs

Applying a buff costs 1 [TP](/obtainables.md#toilet-paper).
Up to 3 buffs may be applied at the same time, with some conditions for what buffs can be simultaneously applied.

1. If a tier buff is selected after already choosing another buff in that tier, it replaces the first one.
2. If a buff is chosen that is incompatible with a previous buff, then the buff chosen replaces the previous buff.
  a. A marker appears next to the buff while selecting it signaling that its incompatible. (Along with another marker showing what its incompatible with.)

Along with this, the player cannot select the same buff 2 or 3 times. (option is greyed out)

Thus, since both replace previously selected buffs, its best to have a single incompatible set of buffs to look through and figure out if its incompatible.
