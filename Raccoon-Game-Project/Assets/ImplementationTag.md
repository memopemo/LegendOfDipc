TODO: Fix Dungeon Tileset in Unity

## Date: March 2, 24

This is sort of where I leave off my current status of implementation so I can start from where I left off.

Last thing I was doing was implementing damage and health from both the player and damageable entities like enemies.

Also knockback. It is currently working.

Specifically in PlayerStateManager.cs where I was implementing player knockback.

Other stuff I did today:
- Added more enemy configuration/customization
- Made enemies and the player flash when taking damage (white for enemies and red for player)
- Replaced the normal srender pipeline with a scriptable render pipeline so that I can have bloom and other effects :)
