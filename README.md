# Raccoon Zelda Game

A top-down 2D zelda game where you play as a raccoon and explore a neighborhood, city, forests, underwater caverns and caves.

You explore and discover weird and occult secrets, like cartoony dungeons in people's basements, and borrow magic yourself.

Your task is to get all 7 keys held by demon cult worshippers to enter the leader's house and defeat him.

Along the way, you will find animal shops, overworld enemies, traps, puzzles, and challenges.

The player can elevate themselves using stairs, and gaining the ability to climb up and down ledges,
allowing for more possibilities in terms of area design.
